Description:
While using Presto, when signing up the field requesting your phone number isn't configured to match the format of the US +1 country code selected.

Severity:
Low

Steps to reproduce:
1 - Open Presto
2 - Initiate sign up process
3 - Select US +1 code for phone number entry 

Expected Result:
The field is configured to accept 10 digits or the ### - ### - #### format

Actual Result:
The field allows ### - ### - #### - ####

Workaround:
None needed as the field still requests a valid number if more than 10 digits are entered.
