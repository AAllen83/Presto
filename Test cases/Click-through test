Description:
As a first time Presto user, I don't expect anywhere on the "Get Started" page to respond to my screen taps other than the "Get Started" button itself.

Test Step(s):
Starting from the top right of the screen, begin tapping until you've tapped everywhere except the "Get Started" button. 

Expected Result:
Confirm no action was rendered.
