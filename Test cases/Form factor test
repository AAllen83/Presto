As a Presto user, I expect the app to remain usable regardless of my phone screen's orientation.

Test Step(s):
Starting from the “Get Started” page.
*Repeat for all applicable pages/views in the app e.g. Map, Plans & Account tabs

Expected Result:
Confirm that all elements of the page remain visible regardless of the screen being shown landscape or portrait style(repeat for unfolded phones such as Samsung Z Fold).
