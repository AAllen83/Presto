Description:
During testing, I observed while switching between tabs that the map view would appear to freeze at a zoomed in perspective which was different from the typical default view.

Serverity:
Low

Steps to reproduce:
1 - Open Presto and observe the map view
2 - Cycle between the Map, Plans and Account tabs.

Expected Result:
Each tab loads fully to it's default view.

Actual Result:
You will notice that eventually the Map view is different from the original view.

Workaround:
You can restore the default view by clicking the compass icon to refresh the view.
